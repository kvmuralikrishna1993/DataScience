#Introduction to Data Science

## Course Overview:
This course is about learning from data, in order to gain useful predictions and insights. Separating signal from noise presents many computational and inferential challenges, which we approach from a perspective at the interface of computer science and statistics. Through real-world examples of wide interest, we introduce methods for five key facets of an investigation:

● data munging/scraping/sampling/cleaning in order to get an informative, manageable data set; 
● data storage and management in order 
● to be able to access data - especially big data - quickly and reliably during subsequent analysis; 
● exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition about the data; 
● prediction based on statistical tools such as regression, classification, and clustering; and 
● communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.

## Learning Outcomes After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

● Use Python and other tools to scrape, clean, and process data 
● Use data management techniques to store data locally and in cloud infrastructures 
● Use statistical methods and visualization to quickly explore data 
● Apply statistics and computational analysis to make predictions based on data 
● Apply basic computer science concepts such as modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation to data analysis problems
